Project - directory history
	> Possible names for the project based on functionalty or methodology
	
Problem:
	> Very often all of us run into the need to browse throughout a bunch of directies we might not know the sake of their names to open the desired folder. Hence, we need to explore directory tree to find the promised land (which is not really bad for curious people). Nonetheless, we've got our time measured to achieve certain goals, and worht to say, time's unvaluable.
	
Antecedent:
	> Is there any program, tool, pluggin to get the cachÃ©ed hisotry of directories we have been trhough?
	
Justification:
	> Coding practice, since we love to implement stuff
	> There's no such thing AFIK, at least I could not find something I woudl like to install and use
	> Could be ported among other UNIX-like machines and distros
